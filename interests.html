    <article class="article">Another thing that I can't get enough of is gaming. I love gaming and<br>consider myself a hardcore gamer. Whenever i'm bored I like to pick up<br>a new interesting game to liven up my life. I am partial to Roblox<br>simply because I have been a part of the community for over 5 years<br>at the time of writing this (2024). I love shooters and let me just say that<br>Team Fortress 2, although it has its shortcomings, bugs, and bots, is a<br>masterpiece. The game has a careful balance of characters that makes no<br>one class too overpowered (except sniper) and emphasizes the<br>importance of every class in the game. It also rewards good players for<br>skill and is somewhat forgiving for newer players. When it comes to<br>Roblox I sometimes play Entry Point but I often play Phantom Forces or<br>Evade.<br><img src="./Pictures/TF2 4K.jpeg" alt="Team Fortress 2 by VALVe Corporation" width="450"></article>
