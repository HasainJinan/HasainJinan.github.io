    <article class="article">While I was in Cybersecurity I did a few projects such as building a PC<br>and making ethernet cables. Personally, I liked PC building the most,<br>but the Virtualization project was pretty fun too. I didn't really like the<br>"Making and Ethernet Cable" project since I found it really frustrating,<br>but I got a perfect score so I can't really complain. If you ever decide to<br>study Cybersecurity, be prepared to pull you hair out when making<br>ethernet cables, unless you are naturally gifted at making them.<br><br></article>
    <article class="article">During Cybersecurity, I had a Full Stack Development course where I<br>created my own personal <a href="https://replit.com/@hjinan/The-Crime-Syndicate#main.py">Text Based Adventure Game,</a> where you use<br>your keyboard to type in the choices you make in the story. I'm proud of<br>the game as it was my biggest coding project at the time, totalling about<br>952 lines of code (majority of which was text for the story). If you ever<br>attempt it, there are 2 proper endings and like 8+ unique fails/deaths, so<br>good luck.<br><br><img src="Pictures/Built_Pc_1.jpeg" alt="Images of the RGB PC built by yours truly" height="300"> <img src="Pictures/Built_Pc_2.jpeg" height="300"></article>
