      <article class="article">While I was in Cybersecurity I did a few projects such as building a PC and making ethernet cables. Personally, I liked PC building the most, but the Virtualization project was pretty fun too. I didn't really like the "Making and Ethernet Cable" project since I found it really frustrating, but I got a perfect score so I can't really complain. If you ever decide to study Cybersecurity, be prepared to pull you hair out when making ethernet cables, unless you are naturally gifted at making them.<br><br></article>
      <article class="article">During Cybersecurity, I had a Full Stack Development course where I created my own personal <a href="https://replit.com/@hjinan/The-Crime-Syndicate#main.py">Text Based Adventure Game,</a> where you use your keyboard to type in the choices you make in the story. I'm proud of the game as it was my biggest coding project at the time, totalling about 952 lines of code (majority of which was text for the story). If you ever attempt it, there are 2 proper endings and like 8+ unique fails/deaths, so good luck. (Oh yea i'm also HTML and CSS Certified)<br><br>My resume is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JQMSE6M3XFwqLEX1uOzpQhIt6MpjOtp4X6uIPNKa-Lk/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a><br><br><img src="Pictures/Built_Pc_1.jpeg" alt="Images of the RGB PC built by yours truly" height="300" class="PC"> <img src="Pictures/Built_Pc_2.jpeg" height="300" class="PC"></article>
